#Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @tarinkazi/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@tarinkazi/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

*assertEqual(val1, val2) : Checks two non-array values and returns true if they are identical, or false if they are not.
*assertObjectsEqual(obj1, obj2) : Compares two objects to see if they are identical. Supports 1 level of array nesting within the object. Supports unlimited nested objects.
*countLetters(str) : Returns an object with a list and number of occurences fo characters in the supplied str.
*countOnly(arr, elem): Returns a count of how many times the element appears in the array.
*eqArrays(arr1, arr2) : Compares two arrays, returns true if they are identical. Supports unlimited nesting of arrays.
*findKey(obj, cb()) : Given an object and callback function, finds the first key for which that value occurs. 

*findKeyByValue(obj, valueStr) : Given an object and value, finds the first key for which that value occurs. No callback function necessary.
*head(arr) : Returns the first item in an array.
letterPositions(str) : Given a string, returns an object with the position(s) of each letter in the string.
*map(arr, cb) : Given an array, returns a new array which meets the conditions of the supplied callback function.
*middle(arr) : Returns the middle element(s) of an array. If array size < 2, returns an empty array.
*tail(arr) : Removes first element and returns the rest of the array.
*takeUntil(arr, cb): Given an array, returns a new array with all elements (from left to right) until the callback function criteria is met.
*without(arr1, arr2): Returns a new array where values of array 2 are not present in array 1.
